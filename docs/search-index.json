Weekly Assignments The sections below show the different Skill Quizzes and Class Activities done throughout the semester. As well as some personal notes on those assignments! Week 1 | Simple Linear Regression We were looking at ‚ÄúThe Mathematical Model‚Äù and ‚ÄúInterpreting Model Parameters‚Äù! Wow! Skill Quiz - Simple Linear Regression Problem 1 Open the airquality dataset in R. Perform a regression of daily average Wind(\\(Y_i\\)) speed using the daily maximum Temperature (\\(X_i\\)) as the explanatory variable. Part (a) Type out the mathematical equation for this regression model and label both \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) in the equation. \\[ \\underbrace{Y_i}_\\text{Wind} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\underbrace{X_i}_\\text{Temp} + \\epsilon_i \\quad \\text{where} \\ \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2) \\] Part (b) Fit and summarize a simple linear regression model for this data. # Type your code there templm <- lm(Wind ~ Temp, data=airquality) summary(templm) %>% pander() ¬† Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 23.23 2.112 11 4.901e-21 Temp -0.1705 0.02693 -6.331 2.642e-09 Fitting linear model: Wind ~ Temp Observations Residual Std. Error \\(R^2\\) Adjusted \\(R^2\\) 153 3.142 0.2098 0.2045 Part (c) Type out the estimated equation for this regression model using your estimates found in part (b). \\[ \\hat{Y}_i = 23.234 + (-0.170)X_i \\] Part (d) Plot the data and the estimated regression model. # Type your code here ggplot(airquality, aes(x=Temp, y=Wind)) + geom_point(size=1.5, color=\"lightblue\", alpha= 0.5) + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", formula=y~x, se=FALSE, size=0.5,color=\"skyblue\")+ theme_minimal() Part (e) Use your model to predict the average daily average Wind speed for an outside temperature of 72 degrees F. \\[ \\hat{Y}_i = 23.234 + (-0.170)(72) \\] # Type your code here 23.234 + (-0.170)*(72) ## [1] 10.994 Part (f) Write out an interpretation of the slope and intercept of your model. Are both meaningful for this data? Slope Interpretation: An increase of 1 degree F in the daily maximum Temperature(\\(X_i\\)) results in a 0.17 mph decrease in the average daily average Wind ($Y_i) speed. Is the slope meaningful?: Yes, the regression seems to be a good fit to this data and the slope is significant so the interpretation of the slope is meaningful for this data. Intercept Interpretation: When the daily maximum Temperature is 0 degrees F, the average daily average Wind speed is estimated to be 23.234 mph. Is the intercept meaningful?: Yes, the intercept is meaningful for this data because it is significant and an outside temperature of 0 degrees F is a meaningful situation. Problem 2 Open the mtcars dataset in R. Fit a regression model to the data that can be used to explain average gas mileage of a vehicle (mpg) (\\(Y_i\\)) using the weight (wt) (\\(X_i\\)) of the vehicle. Part (a) Type out the mathematical equation for this regression model and label both \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) in the equation. \\[ \\underbrace{Y_i}_\\text{mpg} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\underbrace{X_i}_\\text{wt} + \\epsilon_i \\quad \\text{where} \\ \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2) \\] Part (b) Fit and summarize a simple linear regression model for this data. carslm <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data=mtcars) summary(carslm)%>%pander() ¬† Estimate Std.",

A single quantitative response variable is required with one or more qualitative explanatory variables, i.e., factors. Note: A factor is defined as a qualitative variable containing at least two categories. The categories of the factor are referred to as the ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of the factor. One-way ANOVA Each experimental unit is assigned to exactly one factor-level combination. Another way to say this is ‚Äúone measurement per individual‚Äù (no repeated measures) and ‚Äúequal numbers of individuals per group‚Äù. Overview An ANOVA is only appropriate when all of the following are satisfied. The sample(s) of data can be considered to be representative of their population(s). The data is normally distributed in each group. (This can safely be assumed to be satisfied when the residuals from the ANOVA can be assumed to be normally distributed when seen in a Q-Q Plot.) The population variance of each group can be assumed to be the same.

The normality assumption is required. No matter the sample size. If the distributions are skewed then a nonparametric test should be applied instead of ANOVA. One-Way ANOVA One-way ANOVA is when a completely randomized design is used with a single factor of interest. A typical mathematical model for a one-way ANOVA is of the form \\[ Y_{ik} = \\mu_i + \\epsilon_{ik} \\quad (\\text{sometimes written}\\ Y_{ik} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\epsilon_{ik}) \\] where \\(\\mu_i\\) is the mean of each group (or level) \\(i\\) of a factor, and \\(\\epsilon_{ik}\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\) is the error term.

Suddenly you‚Äôll understand.‚Äù Most people that are new to using the ‚ÄúR Software‚Äù ask the question, ‚ÄúHow do I learn R?‚Äù The answer is simple: ‚Äústart using it.‚Äù Really. Seriously. Just start using it, even when you have no idea what you are doing, and suddenly you will start to learn R. So, here we go. The more you use it, the more you will know. This textbook (the ‚ÄúStatistics-Notebook‚Äù) follows a simple learning model: Hover your mouse over codeYes, just like that. By hovering over ‚ÄúCodes‚Äù you will get instructions on what that code does. to read about it. Click on a line of codeHovering is a good start, try clicking on this one. to see what it does. Try typing the code into RStudio yourself to actually start learning R. (This is the most important step! Avoid copying and pasting codes, and type them instead. The more you type codes yourself, even though it is slow and prone to mistakes, the more you will learn.) In summary, the most successful students in Math 325 follow the pattern: Example Codes For each of the following examples: (1) hover, (2) click, and (3) try. Before you begin working on these Example Codes, ensure you have RStudio open. It should look like this: Example 1 Remember, ‚ÄúHover‚Äù the code first, then click, then try. View( The ‚ÄúView‚Äù R function (with a CAPTIAL ‚ÄòV‚Äô in View) allows us to view a data set. When run, this function will open up a new tab in RStudio showing the data set. cars cars is a data set that is in R. R has datasets that are available for anyone to use. You can see them using the data() command. It would be good to explore View() for a few different datasets. ) Always be sure to end your function with closing parantheses. ¬†¬†¬†¬†Press Enter to run the code. ¬†Click to Show Tutorial¬† Click to see a full tutorial on the ‚ÄúView()‚Äù command. Good work clicking on Example Code 1. But‚Ä¶ Did you remember to first hover your mouse over the View(cars) example code? Good job if you did. If not, go do that right now before continuing. R allows you to work with data. So, the first step to understanding R is to open a dataset and begin exploring some data. If you type the data() command into your Console of RStudio you will see a list of ‚Äúbuilt in‚Äù data sets that come with R. Go ahead and type data() into your R Console (and then press Return or Enter) right now to try it yourself. The cars data set is one of the options that is available within the list from the data() command. This is a fun ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù data set from the 1920‚Äôs. It shows the speed and stopping distance of cars from the 1920‚Äôs. To see the cars data set in RStudio, use the View command as follows. Step 1. Open RStudio. Step 2. Type the command View(cars) into your Console. Step 3. Press Enter or Return and the following output should appear within RStudio. Be sure to TRY IT yourself, if you haven‚Äôt already. Good work if you did. It‚Äôs the only way to learn R. Ask someone for help if you aren‚Äôt sure how to get started. Try View(airquality) as well. Example 2 mean( An R function ‚Äúmean()‚Äù that will compute the mean of a quantitative column of data from a data set. cars cars is the name of a data set in R. Any data set can be used instead by simply typing the name of that data set instead of cars. $ The $ sign is a powerful operator in R. The $ sign allows you to access, or ‚Äúpurchase,‚Äù any column from a data set. Try typing cars$ into R and notice how a selection menu appears with options dist and speed. dist dist is one of the two columns from the cars data set. By typing cars$dist we are essentially pulling that column of data out of the data set, and then computing the mean of that column with mean(cars$dist). ) Closing parenthesis for the mean() function. ¬†¬†¬†¬†Press Enter to run the code. ¬†Click to Show Output¬† Click to see ou",

A box is drawn with one edge located at the first quartile and the opposite edge located at the third quartile. This box is then divided into two boxes by placing another line inside the box at the location of the median. The maximum value and minimum value are marked on the plot. Whiskers are drawn from the first quartile out towards the minimum and from the third quartile out towards the maximum. If the minimum or maximum is too far away, then the whisker is ended early. Any points beyond the line ending the whisker are marked on the plot as dots. This helps identify possible outliers in the data. ",

The sample(s) of data can be considered to be representative of their population(s). The data is normally distributed in each group. (This can safely be assumed to be satisfied when the residuals from the ANOVA are normally distributed.) The population variance of each group can be assumed to be the same. (This can be safely assumed to be satisfied when the residuals from the ANOVA show constant variance, i.e., are similarly vertically spread out.) Hypotheses With a two-way ANOVA there are three sets of hypotheses. Writing out the hypotheses can be very involved depending on whether you use the official ‚Äúeffects model‚Äù notation (very mathematically correct) or a simplified ‚Äúmeans model‚Äù notation (which isn‚Äôt very mathematically correct, but gets the idea across in an acceptable way).

The error terms are ‚Äúrandom‚Äù and unique for each individual. This provides the statistical relationship of the regression. It is what allows each dot to be different, while still coming from the same line, or underlying law. \\(\\quad \\text{where}\\) Some extra comments are needed about \\(\\epsilon_i\\)‚Ä¶ \\(\\ \\overbrace{\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)}^\\text{error term normally distributed}\\) The error terms \\(\\epsilon_i\\) are assumed to be normally distributed with constant variance. Pay special note that the \\(\\sigma\\) does not have an \\(i\\) in it, so it is the same for each individual. In other words, the variance is constant. The mean of the errors is zero, which causes the dots to be spread out symmetrically both above and below the line. The estimated regression line obtained from a regression analysis, pronounced ‚Äúy-hat‚Äù, is written as Math Code $$ \\underbrace{\\hat{Y}_i}_\\text{Some Label} = \\overbrace{b_0}^\\text{est. y-int} + \\overbrace{b_1}^\\text{est. slope} \\underbrace{X_i}_\\text{Some Label} $$ \\(\\hat{Y}_i\\) The estimated average y-value for individual \\(i\\) is denoted by \\(\\hat{Y}_i\\).

The significance of the single variable is thus assessed after accounting for the effect of all other variables. If a t Test of a single coefficient is significant, then that variable should remain in the model. If the t Test for a single coefficient is not significant, then the other variables in the model provide the same information that the variable being tested provides.

Using the information from the sample to reach conclusions about the population is called making inference. When statistical inference is performed properly, the conclusions about the population are almost always correct. Hypothesis Testing One of the great focal points of statistics concerns hypothesis testing. Science generally agrees upon the principle that truth must be uncovered by the process of elimination. The process begins by establishing a starting assumption, or null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)). Data is then collected and the evidence against the null hypothesis is measured, typically with the \\(p\\)-value. The \\(p\\)-value becomes small (gets close to zero) when the evidence is extremely different from what would be expected if the null hypothesis were true. When the \\(p\\)-value is below the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) (typically \\(\\alpha=0.05\\)) the null hypothesis is abandoned (rejected) in favor of a competing alternative hypothesis (\\(H_a\\)). Click for an Example The current hypothesis may be that the world is flat. Then someone who thinks otherwise sets sail in a boat, gathers some evidence, and when there is sufficient evidence in the data to disbelieve the current hypothesis, we conclude the world is not flat. In light of this new knowledge, we shift our belief to the next working hypothesis, that the world is round. After a while, someone gathers more evidence and shows that the world is not round, and we move to the next working hypothesis, that it is oblate spheroid, i.e., a sphere that is squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator. This process of elimination is called hypothesis testing. The process begins by establishing a null hypothesis (denoted symbolically by \\(H_0\\)) which represents the current opinion, status quo, or what we will believe if the evidence is not sufficient to suggest otherwise. The alternative hypothesis (denoted symbolically by \\(H_a\\)) designates what we will believe if there is sufficient evidence in the data to discredit, or ‚Äúreject,‚Äù the null hypothesis. See the BYU-I Math 221 Stats Wiki for another example. Managing Decision Errors When the \\(p\\)-value approaches zero, one of two things must be occurring. Either an extremely rare event has happened or the null hypothesis is incorrect. Since the second option, that the null hypothesis is incorrect, is the more plausible option, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative whenever the \\(p\\)-value is close to zero. It is important to remember that rejecting the null hypothesis could however be a mistake. ¬† \\(H_0\\) True \\(H_0\\) False Reject \\(H_0\\) Type I Error Correct Decision Accept \\(H_0\\) Correct Decision Type II Error Type I Error, Significance Level, Confidence and \\(\\alpha\\) A Type I Error is defined as rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

However, practitioners often make an assumption about a detectable difference that is desired which then allows \\(\\beta\\) to be prescribed much like \\(\\alpha\\). In essence, the detectable difference prescribes a fixed value for \\(H_a\\). We can then talk about the power of of a hypothesis test, which is 1 minus the probability of a Type II Error, \\(\\beta\\).

There are many statistical approaches to this problem of measuring the significance of evidence, but in almost all cases, the final measurement of evidence is given by the \\(p\\)-value of the hypothesis test. The \\(p\\)-value of a test is defined as the probability of the evidence being as extreme or more extreme than what was observed assuming the null hypothesis is true. This is an interesting phrase that is at first difficult to understand. The ‚Äúas extreme or more extreme‚Äù part of the definition of the \\(p\\)-value comes from the idea that the null hypothesis will be rejected when the evidence in the data is extremely inconsistent with the null hypothesis.

    "content": "Explanation  Data often varies. The values are not all the same. To capture, or measure how much data varies with a single number is difficult. There are a few different ideas on how to do it, but by far the most used measurement of the variability in data is the standard deviation. The first idea in measuring the variability in data is that there must be a reference point. Something from which everything varies. The most widely accepted reference point is the mean. A deviation is defined as the distance an observation lies from the reference point, the mean. This distance is obtained by subtraction in the order \\(x_i - \\bar{x}\\), where \\(x_i\\) is the data point value and \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the mean of the data. There are thus \\(n\\) deviations because there are \\(n\\) data points. Unfortunately, because of the order of subtraction in obtaining deviations, the average deviation will always work out to be zero. This is because the mean by nature splits the deviations evenly.

'none' : 'block'; } A nonparametric approach to computing the p-value for any test statistic in just about any scenario. Overview In almost all hypothesis testing scenarios, the null hypothesis can be interpreted as follows. \\(H_0\\): Any pattern that has been witnessed in the sampled data is simply due to random chance. Permutation Tests depend completely on this single idea. If all patterns in the data really are simply due to random chance, then the null hypothesis is true. Further, random re-samples of the data should show similar lack of patterns. However, if the pattern in the data is real, then random re-samples of the data will show very different patterns from the original. Consider the following image. In that image, the toy blocks on the left show a clear pattern or structure. They are nicely organized into colored piles. This suggests a real pattern that is not random. Someone certainly organized those blocks into that pattern. The blocks didn‚Äôt land that way by random chance. On the other hand, the pile of toy blocks shown on the right is certainly a random pattern. This is a pattern that would result if the toy blocks were put into a bag, shaken up, and dumped out. This is the idea of the permutation test. If there is structure in the data, then ‚Äúmixing up the data and dumping it out again‚Äù will show very different patterns from the original. However, if the data was just random to begin with, then we would see a similar pattern by ‚Äúmixing up the data and dumping it out again.‚Äù The process of a permutation test is: Compute a test statistic for the original data. Re-sample the data (‚Äúshake it up and dump it out‚Äù) thousands of times, computing a new test statistic each time, to create a sampling distribution of the test statistic. Compute the p-value of the permutation test as the percentage of test statistics that are as extreme or more extreme than the one originally observed. In review, the sampling distribution is created by permuting (randomly rearranging) the data thousands of times and calculating a test statistic on each permuted version of the data. A histogram of the test statistics then provides the sampling distribution of the test statistic needed to compute the p-value of the original test statistic. R Instructions Any permutation test can be performed in R with a for loop. #Step 1 Compute a test statistic for the original data. myTest <- ‚Ä¶perform the initial test‚Ä¶ This could be a t.test, wilcox.test, aov, kruskal.test, lm, glm, chisq.test, or any other R code that results in a test statistic. It could even simply be the mean or standard deviation of the data. observedTestStat <- ‚Ä¶get the test statistic‚Ä¶ Save the test statistic of your test into the object called observedTestStat. For tests that always result in a single test statistic like a t.test, wilcox.test, kruskal.test, and chisq.test it is myTest$statistic. For an aov, lm, or glm try printing summary(myTest)[] to see what values you are interested in using. observedTestStat Print the value of the test statistic of your test to the screen. This is the value that we now need to use to compute the P-value from by finding the probability that a randomly computed test statistic would be ‚Äúmore extreme‚Äù than this originally observed value. #Step 2 Re-sample the data (‚Äúshake it up and dump it out‚Äù) thousands of times, computing a new test statistic each time, to create a sampling distribution of the test statistic. N <- 2000¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† N is the number of times you will reuse the data to create the sampling distribution of the test statistic. A typical choice is 2000, but sometimes 10000, or 100000 reuses are needed before useful answers can be obtained. permutedTestStats <-¬† This is a storage container that will be used to store the test statistics from each of the thousands of reuses of the data. rep(NA, N) The rep() function repeats a given value N times.

How the permuting is performed depends on the type of hypothesis test being performed. It is important to remember that the permutation test only changes the way the p-value is calculated. Everything else about the original test is unchanged when switching to a permutation test. Independent Samples t Test For the independent sample t Test, we will use the data from the independent sleep analysis. In that analysis, we were using the sleep data to test the hypotheses: \\[ H_0: \\mu_\\text{Extra Hours of Sleep with Drug 1} - \\mu_\\text{Extra Hours of Sleep with Drug 2} = 0 \\] \\[ H_a: \\mu_\\text{Extra Hours of Sleep with Drug 1} - \\mu_\\text{Extra Hours of Sleep with Drug 2} \\neq 0 \\] We used a significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) and obtained a P-value of \\(0.07939\\).

'none' : 'block'; } Much of statistical inference concerns the location of the population mean \\(\\mu\\) for a given parametric distribution. Some of the most common approaches to making inference about \\(\\mu\\) utilize a test statistic that follows a t distribution. One Sample t Test A one sample t test is used when there is a hypothesized value for the population mean \\(\\mu\\) of a single quantitative variable. Overview Questions The one sample t test can be used to answer questions like: How long does it take to drive from Rexburg, ID to Salt Lake City, UT on average? Is human body temperature really 98.6&deg; F on average? Do I spend less than $3 a day, on average, purchasing snacks? Requirements This test is only appropriate when both of the following are satisfied. The sample is representative of the population. (Having a simple random sample is the best way to do this.) The sampling distribution of the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) can be assumed to be normal. This is a safe assumption when either (a) the population data can be assumed to be normally distributed using a Q-Q Plot or (b) the size of the sample (n) that was taken from the population is large (at least n > 30, but ‚Äúlarge‚Äù really depends on how badly the data is skewed). If the requirements listed above are satisfied, then the results of the test can be trusted to give meaningful inference about the population. If the requirements are not met, then that doesn‚Äôt mean the results of the test are necessarily bad, but there is no guarantee that they are good. Hypotheses Math Code $$ H_0: \\mu = 5.2 $$ $$ H_a: \\mu \\neq 5.2 $$ \\(H_0: \\mu = \\text{some number}\\) \\(H_a: \\mu \\ \\left\\{\\underset{<}{\\stackrel{>}{\\neq}}\\right\\} \\ \\text{some number}\\) Examples: analysis resubmits R Instructions Console Help Command: ?t.test() t.test(NameOfYourData$Y, mu = YourNull, alternative = YourAlternative, conf.level = 0.95) NameOfYourData is the name of your data set, like mtcars or KidsFeet.

Math Code $$ H_0: \\text{difference in medians} = 0 $$ $$ H_a: \\text{difference in medians} \\neq 0 $$ \\(H_0: \\text{difference in medians} = 0\\) \\(H_a: \\text{difference in medians} \\neq 0\\) However, the test also allows for the more general hypotheses that one distribution is stochastically greater than the other. \\(H_0: \\text{the distributions are stochastically equal}\\) \\(H_a: \\text{one di",

Option 1: wilcox.test(Y ~ X, data = YourData, mu = YourNull, alternative = YourAlternative, conf.level = 0.95) Y must be a ‚Äúnumeric‚Äù vector from YourData that represents the data for both samples. X must be a ‚Äúfactor‚Äù or ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù vector from YourData that represents the group assignment for each observation. There can only be two groups specified in this column of data. YourNull is the numeric value from your null hypothesis for the difference in medians from the two groups. YourAlternative is one of the three options: \"two.sided\", \"greater\", \"less\" and should correspond to your alternative hypothesis. The value for conf.level = 0.95 can be changed to any desired confidence level, like 0.90 or 0.99. It should correspond to \\(1-\\alpha\\).

    "content": "Explanation  In many cases it is of interest to perform a hypothesis test concerning the equality of the centers of two (possibly different) distributions. In other words, an independent samples test. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test allows a nonparametric approach to doing this. It is often considered the nonparametric equivalent of the independent samples t test. The method is most easily explained through an example. The theory behind it is very similar to the theory behind the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Independent Samples Data Example Note: the data for this example comes from the original 1945 paper Individual Comparison by Ranking Methods by Frank Wilcoxon. Background The percent of flies (bugs) killed from two different concentrations of a certain spray were recorded from 16 different trials, 8 trials per treatment concentration. The experiment hypothesized that the center of the distributions of the percent killed by either concentration were the same. In other words, that both treatments were ",
