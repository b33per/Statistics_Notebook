### What is a Residual?


<br>

A **residual** is just the difference between:

- What you **actually observed** ($Y_i$)
- What your model **predicted** ($\hat{Y_i}$)

$$r_i = Y_i - \hat{Y_i}$$

Think of it as "how far off was my prediction of that jar of jelly beans?"

##### Why do residuals matter?


- They help check if your model is working well by looking for:
  - Whether relationships between variables are truly linear
  - If the spread of errors is consistent
  - If errors follow a normal distribution
  - If data points are independent of each other

When looking at residual plots, **you want to see points scattered randomly** - like if someone threw a bunch of marbles on the floor (accidentally of course). If you see **clear patterns**, something might be wrong with your model.



---

##### Real Life Comparison for Residuals


<u>Imagine you're baking cookies:</u>

- The recipe says they should take exactly 12 minutes to bake
  - But the actual baking times might be:
    - Batch 1: 13 minutes (residual = +1)
    - Batch 2: 11 minutes (residual = -1)
    - Batch 3: 12 minutes (residual = 0)


The residual is how far off your actual baking time was from the **predicted** 12 minutes. **Sometimes it's over, sometimes under, and sometimes exactly right** (just depends on how burnt you like your cookies, JK).

This helps you see how accurate your recipe's timing prediction is for each batch of cookies.


<br>

---

### What is a Sum of Squares Error (SSE)?



A **SSE** is the **measurement of how much the residuals(the observed value - the predicted value) deviate from the line(the law)**. This can also be explained as the amount of variability that is NOT explained by the model. 

- We want this to be **small**, relative to SSTO (total variability)
- Can never be negative



This is calculated by the following model: 

$$SSE = \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n}_\text{The sum of} (\underbrace{Y_i}_\text{Observed Value(The Dots)} - \underbrace{\hat{Y_i}}_\text{Predicted Value (The Line)})^2 $$

<br>

---

##### Why does the SSE matter?



**We want these differences to be small** compared to how much your drive times vary overall (SSTO).

- If they're small, it means our prediction is doing a good job!!
- And just like you can't have a negative amount of variation (you can't vary "negative minutes" from your prediction), these measures can't be negative.



---


##### Real Life Comparison of SSE


<u>Think of predicting how long it takes to drive to work:</u>

Your **actual drive times vary** (maybe 20, 25, or 30 minutes depending on things traffic, how fast you drive, who knows?), **but** your **prediction model** says it always takes 23 minutes 

- The **unexplained variability** is all those differences between your actual times and your 23-minute prediction! (aka the SSE)

<br>

---

### What is a Sum of Squares Regression (SSR)? 



A **SSR** is **the measurement of how much the regression line (the law) departs from the average y-value (overall mean)**. This can also be explained as the amount of variability EXPLAINED by the model by showing how far our predicted y values deviate from the overall mean. 

- We want this to be large relative to SSTO
- Can never be negative



This can be calculated by the following model:

$$SSR = \underbrace{\sum_{i = 1}^n}_\text{The sum of} (\underbrace{\hat{Y_i}}_\text{Predicted Y (The Line)} - \underbrace{\bar{Y}}_\text{Average Y (Overall Mean)})^2$$


*Click between tabs for further explanations*

#### { .tabset .tabset-pills}

##### Hide SSR Explainations


---

##### Why does SSR matter?

<br>

SSR matters because **it tells us how good our predictions are**.

It shows how much of what we're trying to predict **can actually be explained by our model**
- A **larger** SSR means our predictions are **more reliable and useful**
- It helps us decide if our prediction method is worth using


<br>

---

##### Real life Comparison of SSR

<br>

<u>Imagine predicting pizza delivery times:</u>

The delivery app says:

- Small orders: 20 minutes
- Medium orders: 30 minutes
- Large orders: 40 minutes

SSR **measures how much these categories actually help EXPLAIN delivery times**. For example:

- If order size really **DOES** determine delivery time, then **SSR would be large**
  - order size is actually a useful factor for making predictions
  - meaning **your prediction system works well**

- If delivery times are **RANDOM** regardless of order size, then **SSR would be small**   - we might need to consider other factors like time of day or distance instead  
  - meaning **your prediction system isn't very helpful**


Just like you can't have "negative accuracy" in predictions, SSR can't be negative. The **bigger** the SSR compared to total variation (SSTO), the **better** your prediction model is working.

<br>

---

### What is a Sum of Squares Total (SSTO)?

<br>

A **SSTO** is **the measurement of how much the y-values departs from the average y- value**. This can also be explained as the total variability of our model. 

- Largest of the three values
- Can never be negative

<br>

**Key Relationship:**
SSTO = SSR + SSE -> Total Variation = Explained Variation + Unexplained Variation

<br>

- SSR/SSTO represents the proportion of variability explained by the model (RÂ²)
- The smallest possible value for all three is 0
- SSTO will always be the largest, as it represents total variability in the response variable (y). 

<br>

This is calculated by the following:

$$SSR + SSE = SSTO = \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n}_\text{The sum of} (\underbrace{Y_i}_\text{Observed Y Values (The Dots)} - \underbrace{\bar{Y}}_\text{Average Y (Overall Mean)})^2$$

<br>

##### Hide SSTO Explainations

<br>

---

##### Why does SSTO matter?

<br>

The total variation (SSTO) helps us to know **if our predictions are actually useful or just lucky guesses**!

- A good model has **large SSR** (Explained Variation) and **small SSE** (Unexplained Variation) relative to SSTO (Total Variation)
  - if it is the other way around, that means our model is not very good

<br>

---

##### Real Life Comparison of SSTO

<br>

<u>Imagine you own a coffee shop and want to understand your daily sales patterns:</u>

**Total Variation (SSTO):**

- Your daily sales vary between 80-150 cups per day
- This is the total range of how much your sales go up and down

<br>

**This total variation can be broken into two parts**:

1. **Explained Variation (SSR):**
- Things you can predict 
  - like selling more coffee on cold days or your coffee shop is holding a fundraiser
- If cold days and planned fundraisers consistently mean more sales, this is a reliable pattern



2. **Unexplained Variation (SSE):**
- Random things you can't predict
  - like a surprise business meeting nearby, or a bus full of high schoolers get dropped off here (yikes)
- These are the *mystery factors* affecting your sales

<br>

The **better** your prediction model, the **more of your total variation (SSTO) is explained by your model (SSR)**, and the **less remains unexplained** (SSE).


<br>

---

### What is R-squared?


<br>

The **R-squared** is **the proportion of variability in Y** that can be **explained** by the regression.

<u>Definition breakdown:</u>

- Proportion: meaning $R^2$ is always between 0 and 1 (aka. 0% - 100%), thus representing **how much variation is captured by the model**
- Variability: how **spread out** the Y values are from their mean
- Explained: how much of that spread **can be accounted for** by the repression line

$$R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SSTO} = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SSTO} $$

<br>

#### { .tabset .tabset-pills}

##### Hide R Squared Explainations

<br>

---

##### Why does R Squared matter?

<br>

It tells us **how reliable** our predictions are!
- Additionally, it shows us **how confident** we can be in our predictions

<br>

**R-squared VS P-value**

We can further understand R-squared by how it differs from the p-value for slope:

- R-squared measures the **how well the X variable explains the variation in Y**
- P-value indicates **whether the relationship is statistically significant**

<br>

---

##### Real Life Comparison for R Squared

<br>

<u>Imagine you're analyzing how a cat's playtime affects their sleep duration:</u>

- **Variability**: Your cat's daily sleep hours vary - some days they sleep a lot, other days less
- **R-squared**: If your analysis shows an R-squared of 0.80, this means that 80% of the changes in sleep duration can be explained by how much playtime they had
- **Unexplained variation**: The remaining 20% might be due to other factors like weather, visitors in the house, or feeding schedule
- **P-value comparison:** The p-value would tell you whether the relationship between playtime and sleep is statistically significant or just random chance. A low p-value would suggest that the relationship is real and not coincidental.

This demonstrates the key concepts from the selection: **proportion (80% explained), variability (fluctuating sleep patterns), and what can be explained by the regression (playtime's effect)**.




<br>

### What is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) & the "Residual Standard Error"(RSE)? 


<br>

The **MSE** is **the measurement of the average squared difference** between predicted and actual values
- Can be **any non-negative number** (0 to infinity)
- Units are squared units of the original data (e.g., degrees FahrenheitÂ²)

$$MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-p}$$

<br>

**Relationship to R-squared**

| MSE | R-Squared |
| --- | --- |
| measures **squared prediction error** | measures **proportion of variance in y explained** |
| between 0 and infinity | between 0 and 1 (0% - 100%) |
| units are squared units of the original data | unitless |

    
    
<br>

The **Residual Standard Error** (RSE) is **the square root of MSE**.
- Found in R regression summary output
  - Uses same units as original data (e.g., degrees Fahrenheit)
  
$$RSE = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{\frac{SSE}{n-p}}$$

<br>

--- 

##### Why do the MSE and the RSE matter?

<br>

Together, they indicate the fit of our model:

- **Lower values** of MSE and RSE indicate **better model fit**
- They help assess the accuracy of predictions in the original data's scale

<br>

---

##### Real Life Comparison of MSE and Residual Error

<br>


<u>Think of predicting daily temperatures:</u>

The **MSE** would be like measuring **how far off your temperature predictions are on average**, but the errors are **squared**
- If you predict 75Â°F and it's actually 73Â°F
  - that's a difference of 2Â°F, which gets squared to 4Â°FÂ²
  - **The MSE would be the average of all these squared differences**

<br>

The **Residual Standard Error (RSE)** would **convert this back to the original temperature units by taking the square root**
- So instead of 4Â°FÂ², you'd get back to a value in Â°F
- **making it more intuitive to understand how far off your predictions typically are**

<br>

**Lower values** in both cases would mean **your temperature predictions are more accurate!!** 
- aka. you're better at forecasting the actual temperatures that occur! (like a psychic)

<br>

## Application on Weather Prediction Analysis

<br>

For this study, we were tasked with **predicting the "Actual Maximum Air Temperature" for this coming Monday, January 13th at BYU-Idaho**. BYU-Idaho is located in the city of Rexburg, Idaho, and thus we will use this city's weather recordings from [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/@5605242/historic?month=1&year=2025) to make our predictions. 

<br>

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
janweather <- read.csv("C:/Users/paige/OneDrive/Documents/Fall Semester 2024/MATH 325/Statistics-Notebook-master/Data/JanWeather.csv")

prediction <- data.frame(
  STARTMAXTEMP=16,
  MAXTEMP= 26,
  label = "Prediction Point : 26Â°F"
)

janweathery_plot <- ggplot(janweather, aes(x = STARTMAXTEMP, y = MAXTEMP)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(
      text = paste(
        "Date:", DATE, "<br>",
        "Start Max Temp. of the Day:", STARTMAXTEMP, "\u00b0F<br>",
        "Max Temp. of the Day:", MAXTEMP, "\u00b0F"
      )
    ),
    size = 2,
    color = "darkblue"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula= y~x, se = FALSE, color = "dodgerblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Weather Patterns from January 13th's of the Past",
    x = "Max Start Temperature of the Day (\u00b0F)",
    y = "Max Temperature of the Day (\u00b0F)"
  ) +
  geom_point(data=prediction,
             aes(x=STARTMAXTEMP, y=MAXTEMP),
             size = 3,
             color= "red") +
  geom_text(
    data = prediction,
    aes(x = STARTMAXTEMP, y=MAXTEMP, label = label),
    nudge_x = -7,
    nudge_y = 3.6,
    color= "red",
    size = 3
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(janweathery_plot, tooltip = "text")
```


<br>

This is our mathematical model: 
$$\underbrace{Y_i}_\text{MAXTEMP} = \overbrace{\beta_0}^\text{Intercept} + \overbrace{\beta_1}^\text{Slope} \underbrace{X_i}_\text{STARTMAXTEMP}+ \epsilon_i \text{ where} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$


<br>

This is our Simple Linear Regression test: 
```{r}
janlm <- lm(MAXTEMP ~ STARTMAXTEMP, data=janweather)

summary(janlm)%>%
  pander()
```

<br>

***Using this study, we will go further in depth with applying how residuals work in this study.***

### What does the residual tell us about our predicted temperature for Monday January 13th?

<br>

As a reminder **residuals are the difference between the observed value ($Y_i$) and the predicted value ($\hat{Y_i}$)**.

In context of this study, the residual of a given point would be the difference between the observed `MAXTEMP` and the predicted `MAXTEMP`. This can be depicted as the following: 

$$Residual = \text{Observed MAXTEMP - Predicted MAXTEMP}$$
Below is the table of residuals for all 8 of the points used in this data set. 

```{r}
pander(janlm$residuals)

```


|Residual Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | 
| Positive Residual(+) | the prediction `MAXTEMP` is **lower** than the observed `MAXTEMP` (aka. an under prediction) |
| Negative Residual(-) | the prediction `MAXTEMP` is **higher** than the observed `MAXTEMP` (aka. an over prediction)| 
| Close to 0 | the prediction `MAXTEMP` is **very close** to the observed `MAXTEMP` (aka. a good fit prediction) |

<center>

The graphic below shows us pink dots as a visualization of the <span style="background-color:pink;">residuals</span>. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
janweather$predicted_MAXTEMP <- predict(janlm)

janweather$residuals <- janweather$MAXTEMP - janweather$predicted_MAXTEMP


ggplot(janweather, aes(x = STARTMAXTEMP, y = MAXTEMP)) +
  geom_point(
    size = 2,
    color = "pink"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE, color = "black") +  # Mean line
  # Add vertical lines representing residuals
  geom_segment(aes(x = STARTMAXTEMP, xend = STARTMAXTEMP, y = predicted_MAXTEMP, yend = MAXTEMP),
               color = "pink", linetype = "solid", size = 0.8) +  # Residuals (error lines)
  labs(title = "Residuals of Weather Prediction Analysis") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### How do the SSE, SSR, and SSTO apply to this study? 

<br>

These values are depicted below:
```{r}
janweather$predicted_MAXTEMP <- predict(janlm)

janweather$residuals <- janweather$MAXTEMP - janweather$predicted_MAXTEMP

SSTO <- sum((janweather$MAXTEMP - mean(janweather$MAXTEMP))^2)

SSR <- sum((janweather$predicted_MAXTEMP - mean(janweather$MAXTEMP))^2)

SSE <- sum(janweather$residuals^2)

pander(cat("SSE:", round(SSE,2), "\n"))
pander(cat("SSR:", round(SSR,2), "\n"))
pander(cat("SSTO:", round(SSTO,2), "\n"))
```

Here is how these concepts apply: 

| Concept | Meaning | Application | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) | measures the **unexplainable** variation in the data | - how much of the variation in `MAXTEMP` is not explained by the relationship with `STARTMAXTEMP`- We want our SSE to be **smaller than our SSTO** as that indicates our model is a good fit and the amount of unexplained variability we have, and with a SSE of 109.66, this confirms that our model is a good fit and doesn't have a lot of unexplained variability  |
| Sum of Squared Regression (SSR) | measures the **explainable** variation in the data | - how much of the variation in `MAXTEMP` is explained by the relationship with `STARTMAXTEMP`- We want our SSR to be **big** as that indicates our model is a good fit, and with a SSR of 684.34 this confirms that our model does a good job at explaining the variability of `MAXTEMP` and a good fit for our data |
| Sum of Squared Total(SSTO) | measures the **total variation** in the data, combining the explained and unexplained parts | - total variability in `MAXTEMP` |

### What does R Squared offer to this study? 

<br>

In this study, **R Squared explains how well our independent variable, `STARTMAXTEMP`, explains/predicts the variability in our dependent variable, `MAXTEMP`**.

You can find our R Squared value by either computing in the equation below or by looking in our Simple Linear Regression Test under $R^2$.

<br>

$$R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SSTO} = \frac{684.34}{794} = 0.8619	$$

<br>

```{r}
janlm <- lm(MAXTEMP ~ STARTMAXTEMP, data=janweather)

summary(janlm)%>%
  pander()
```


<br>

With this value, we can interpret our **0.8619 $R^2$** value with the following table: 

| $R^2$ Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | 
| between 0 and 1 | Perfect fit, perfectly variablility in `MAXTEMP` using `STARTMAXTEMP` |
| around 0 | Not a good fit, does not explain ANY variablility in `MAXTEMP` and there is no relationship between the two variables |

- Our $R^2$ shows **86.19%** of variation in `MAXTEMP` that can be explained with the `STARTMAXTEMP`
  - The remaining percentage can be seen as some variation due to some random other factors
  - Overall, our $R^2$ assesses that **the linear regression model does fit this data well**.
  
Below is a graph displaying red and blue boxes to depict how the <span style="background-color:red;">SSE</span> and the <span style="background-color:blue;">SSTO</span> divide by eachother, to then subtract from 1 to achieve $R^2$.

### How does the MSE and "Residual Standard Error"(RSE) apply to this study?

<br>

Both the MSE and the "Residual Standard Error" help in assessing the accuracy and reliability of our weather prediction model. 
- MSE giving us the overall unitless measure of our prediction error 
  - Lower MSE: model is doing well in predicting the Y(`MAXTEMP`) from the X(`STARTTEMP`)
  - Higher MSE: model is NOT doing well in predicting the Y(`MAXTEMP`) from the X(`STARTTEMP`), as the data does not fit well
- "Residual Standard Error" gives us a specific unit measurement of how much error is present in our model's predictions

```{r}
predictions <- predict(janlm)

MSE <- mean((janweather$MAXTEMP - predictions)^2)

rse <- sqrt(MSE)

pander(cat("MSE:", round(MSE,2), "\n"))
pander(cat("RSE:", round(rse,2), "Â°F"))
```

<br>

With these values we are able to deduce the following: 
- MSE: The average of all the squared differences is **13.71**
- RSE: On average, the `MAXTEMP` from our study is **about 3.7Â°F from the actual values**

This can be visualized using the graph below, the length of one side of the purple boxes being the <span style="background-color:purple;">RSE</span> and the dark green box in the left hand corner being the <span style="background-color:darkgreen;">MSE</span>. 

<center>

```{r}
ggplot(janweather, aes(x = STARTMAXTEMP, y = MAXTEMP)) +
  geom_point(
    size = 2,
    color = "purple"
  ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE, color = "black") +  # Mean line
  # Add vertical lines representing residuals
  geom_segment(aes(x = STARTMAXTEMP, xend = STARTMAXTEMP, y = predicted_MAXTEMP, yend = MAXTEMP),
               color = "purple", linetype = "solid", size = 0.8) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=STARTMAXTEMP, xmax=STARTMAXTEMP+janlm$res, ymin=MAXTEMP , ymax=janlm$fit), alpha = 0.3, color="purple") +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=1, xmax=1+3.7, ymin=40, ymax=40+3.7), color='darkgreen', alpha=0.1) +
  labs(title = "Residuals of Weather Prediction Analysis") +
  theme_minimal()
```
